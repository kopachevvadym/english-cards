# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add support for dual data providers in the flashcard application, allowing users to choose between storing their flashcard data locally (localhost) or in a MongoDB database. A settings menu will provide an easy way to switch between these data sources, giving users flexibility in how they manage their flashcard data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose between local storage and MongoDB for my flashcard data, so that I can have control over where my data is stored and accessed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load flashcard data from the currently selected data provider
2. WHEN a user switches data providers THEN the system SHALL persist the selection for future sessions
3. IF no data provider is selected THEN the system SHALL default to localhost storage
4. WHEN switching between providers THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity without loss

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access a settings menu to configure my data provider preference, so that I can easily switch between local and cloud storage options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the settings menu THEN the system SHALL display current data provider selection
2. WHEN a user selects a different data provider THEN the system SHALL update the configuration immediately
3. WHEN the settings menu is opened THEN the system SHALL show both localhost and MongoDB options clearly
4. WHEN a data provider is selected THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation of the selection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my flashcard operations (create, read, update, delete) to work seamlessly regardless of which data provider I choose, so that the user experience remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL route requests to the active data provider
2. WHEN adding new flashcards THEN the system SHALL store them in the selected data provider
3. WHEN updating flashcards THEN the system SHALL modify data in the active provider
4. WHEN deleting flashcards THEN the system SHALL remove them from the active provider
5. WHEN retrieving flashcards THEN the system SHALL fetch from the active provider

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle connection errors gracefully, so that I can continue using the app even if one data provider becomes unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a data provider connection fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
2. WHEN MongoDB is unavailable THEN the system SHALL allow fallback to localhost storage
3. WHEN connection errors occur THEN the system SHALL not crash or lose user progress
4. WHEN reconnection is possible THEN the system SHALL attempt to restore the preferred data provider

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to store additional context for my flashcards including usage examples, so that I can better understand and remember word meanings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or editing flashcards THEN the system SHALL allow adding example sentences for words
2. WHEN creating or editing flashcards THEN the system SHALL allow adding translated examples
3. WHEN displaying flashcards THEN the system SHALL show examples and translations when available
4. WHEN switching data providers THEN the system SHALL preserve all card fields including examples

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean abstraction layer for data providers, so that adding new storage options in the future is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing data providers THEN the system SHALL use a common interface for all providers
2. WHEN adding new providers THEN the system SHALL require minimal changes to existing code
3. WHEN switching providers THEN the system SHALL use dependency injection or similar patterns
4. WHEN data operations are performed THEN the system SHALL abstract provider-specific implementation details
